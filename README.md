#☁️ Cloud Cost Guardian

An automated AWS cost and carbon monitoring system that detects underutilised cloud resources and estimates potential financial and environmental savings.

---

## 📌 Overview

Cloud Cost Guardian helps identify wasted AWS infrastructure by analysing usage patterns and translating them into:

- 💰 Estimated cost savings  
- 🌱 Carbon emission impact  

It supports data-driven optimisation for more sustainable cloud operations.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- Scans EC2 and EBS usage using AWS APIs  
- Collects metrics via CloudWatch  
- Detects idle and underutilised resources  
- Estimates avoidable cloud spend  
- Calculates related CO₂ emissions  
- Displays insights in an interactive Streamlit dashboard  
- Supports automated execution using AWS Lambda and EventBridge

##📄 Academic Context
This project was developed as part of my MSc dissertation in Software Engineering (Cloud Computing).

The research focused on:

Analysing cloud infrastructure inefficiencies

Quantifying financial and environmental impact

Designing automated monitoring pipelines

Evaluating optimisation opportunities

The full academic report is available upon request.

##🔮 Future Enhancements
Extending the analysis to other AWS services such as RDS, S3, and Load Balancers

Improving cost prediction using more accurate forecasting methods

Enhancing detection of unusual or inefficient resource usage

Using more detailed regional data to improve carbon emission estimates

Supporting monitoring across multiple AWS accounts

Providing automated recommendations for cost and energy optimisation
